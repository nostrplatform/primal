This Agreement constitutes a binding obligation between you and Primal. Services are provided by Primal, including our affiliates, as applicable. By using our Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, and any additional provisions and conditions provided to you for your use of Services (collectively, the “Policies”), which may include terms and conditions from third parties. If you don’t agree to all the stated terms, you may not use our Services.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We will periodically revise and update this Agreement and post the updated version to Primal’s Website, as further described in Section 9 (Changes to Agreement or Services).\n      </p>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>\n          1.

Your private key grants you full and exclusive control over your account on the public Nostr network. Your responsibility is to keep your private key secret and safely stored.

You have the right to use your Nostr account on third party services by logging in via your private key. If you wish to do so, you may completely abandon using Primal and continue using your Nostr account on third party services. As a sovereign owner of your Nostr account, you don’t require Primal’s permission nor cooperation to use your Nostr account as you deem fit.\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n          <h3>1.3 Content ownership.</h3>\n          You retain all your ownership rights to the content you create.

Exceeding the specified limit means that your older media will be deleted to make room for the new files you are uploading. Primal may change the Free Tier storage and file size limits at any time.

You acknowledge and agree that through your use of the Services, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as set forth in the Privacy Policy. In providing the personal information of any individual (other than yourself) that may receive transactions from you as part of your use of the Services, you agree that you have obtained consent from such individual to disclose their personal information to us, as well as their consent to our collection, use, storage, and disclosure of such personal information, in the manner and for the purposes set out in our Privacy Policy.\n        </section>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>\n          3. Premium Service\n        </h2>\n\n        <section>\n          <h3>3.1 Premium Service Definition.</h3>\n          Primal Premium Service is an optional, subscription-based, paid tier offered to you, which includes Primal Orange Check as defined in section 3.2 of this Agreement, increased media storage, and certain premium features, as defined on Primal's Website.\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n          <h3>3.2 Primal Orange Check.</h3>\n          Primal Orange Check is a service that provides a personalized username at primal.net (“Primal Name”) to all Primal Premium Service users. Primal Orange Check includes a verified Nostr Address at primal.net, Bitcoin Lightning Address at primal.net, and a VIP profile address at primal.net. By way of example, a user who selected \"preston\" as their Primal Name would have \"preston@primal.net\" as their verified Nostr Address, \"preston@primal.net\" as their Bitcoin Lightning Address, and \"primal.net/preston\" as their VIP profile address.\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n          <h3>3.3 Primal Name Ownership.</h3>\n          Primal remains the exclusive owner of all Primal Names. Primal Name is rented, not sold, to you for the duration of your subscription, as defined in section 3.4 of this Agreement. Primal reserves the right to revoke any Primal Name at any time, without prior notice, if we determine that the name is trademarked by somebody else, that there is a possible case of impersonation, or for any other reason at our sole discretion. Purchasing a Primal Premium Service subscription grants you the right to use a Primal Name for the duration of the subscription, but Primal makes no guarantees that your selected name will remain available to you for the duration of your subscription. Should the name you have selected be revoked by Primal during your subscription term, you have the right to select another name, provided that this new name is available and acceptable to Primal.\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n          <h3>3.4 Premium Service Duration.</h3>\n          Primal Premium Service will be offered for the duration specified during the purchase process. Primal will clearly display the expiration date of your subscription in your Premium Profile Settings. You are allowed to renew and extend your subscription at any time. Primal reserves the right to terminate your subscription for a cause, as described in Section 5 of this Agreement (Cancellation, Suspension, or Termination of Services).\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n          <h3>3.5 Expired Premium Subscription.</h3>\n          If you allow your Premium Service subscription to expire, you will lose all Premium Service benefits. Upon expiration, Primal will offer a Grace Period of seven days, during which your Premium Service benefits will continue to be available to you at no charge. After the expiration of the Grace Period, your Primal Name will no longer be associated with your Nostr account and will become available to another user to reserve. Your media storage in excess of the allotment offered to Free Tier users will be deleted from Primal's servers.\n        </section>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>\n          4. Hosted Wallet Service\n        </h2>\n\n        <section>\n          <h3>4.1 Premium Service Definition.</h3>\n          Primal Hosted Wallet Service is an optional service offered to you, which includes storing small amounts of bitcoin on your behalf, as defined in Section 4.3 Maximum Wallet Balance, the ability to send and receive bitcoin transactions on your behalf, the display of your transaction history, and hosting a Bitcoin Lightning Address assigned to you.\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n          <h3>4.2 Primal Orange Check.</h3>\n          Bitcoin custody, send, and receive operations are performed by Primal's affiliate Zap Solutions, Inc. (\"Strike\"). By using our Hosted Wallet Service, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, as well as Strike's Terms of Service, as defined at https://strike.me/legal/tos/. Primal reserves the right to change the Wallet Third Party Service provider without prior notice, or to bring some or all of these services in-house. All such changes will be reflected in an update to this Agreement, as further described in Section 9 (Changes to Agreement or Services).\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n          <h3>4.3 Maximum Wallet Balance.</h3>\n          The purpose of our Hosted Wallet Service is to provide an easy-to-use spending bitcoin wallet with minimal setup effort. You should not use the Primal Hosted Wallet Service to store amounts that exceed the value you would carry in a physical spending wallet. For larger amounts, Primal recommends self-custody, preferably in a bitcoin-specialized hardware wallet. Primal is enforcing a Maximum Wallet Balance to ensure that all users are using our Hosted Wallet Service for the purpose it was designed for. Your Maximum Wallet Balance is displayed in your Wallet Settings. If you attempt to credit your wallet with an amount that would exceed your Maximum Wallet Balance, you may need to contact Primal Support at support@primal.net to get a refund.\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n          <h3>4.4 Wallet Activation and Control.</h3>\n          When you activate your Primal Wallet and register for the Hosted Wallet Service, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information as prompted by the registration form. Your wallet is controlled by your Nostr private key (starting with \"nsec\") and the verified email address you provided during registration. It is your responsibility to keep your Nostr private key secret and safely stored, as well as to ensure that nobody else has access to the email account you used to register for our Hosted Wallet Service. If either your Nostr private key or your email account get compromised, this may result in loss of funds in your Primal Wallet. Primal assumes no responsibility nor liability for loss of funds resulting from a compromised private key and/or email account.\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n          <h3>4.5 Transaction Fees.</h3>\n          Transaction fees for incoming and outgoing payments within your Primal Wallet are a combination of bitcoin network fees, fees charged by Primal's affiliates (if any), and fees charged by Primal (if any). Transaction fee policy is subject to change without notice. Primal Wallet will clearly display the fees charged for each transaction on the Transaction Details screen.\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n          <h3>4.6 In-app Purchase Fees.</h3>\n          Primal Wallet offers the ability to purchase small amounts of bitcoin, typically in USD $5 increments, via the Apple/Google in-app purchase. Apple and Google charge a considerable fee for these transactions. Prior to your purchase, Primal will clearly display the exact amount of bitcoin (expressed in satoshis) that you will receive for the specific fiat amount you will be paying. Primal makes no revenue from in-app purchases. All in-app purchases are final, Primal offers no refunds.\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n          <h3>4.7 Mistaken and Unauthorized Transactions.</h3>\n          All payments made via the Primal Hosted Wallet Service are final.

Primal accepts no liability for mistaken or unauthorized transactions.\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n          <h3>4.8 Taxes.</h3>\n          It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes you owe in relation to bitcoin transactions, including spending, buying, and selling bitcoin. It is your responsibility to report and remit any such tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that Primal is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your use of the Services, including your transactions, or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from your use of the Services.\n        </section>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>\n          5.
